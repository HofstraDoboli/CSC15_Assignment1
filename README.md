## Assignment 1 - CSC 15

Implement the BEETLE game between a player and the computer: 

* The first player to roll a dice is determined by an initial dice roll or rolls until one of the players has a higher score than the other. The player with the highest score starts the game.

* In each round, the first player rolls a dice and determines if a body part can be added to its beetle. Then the second player does the same thing. 

* Repeat playing another round until one of the players has a full beetle.  

A full beetle will have one body, a head, two antennae, two eyes, 6 legs and  1 tail.   

The dice roll mapping to a body part is:

        1 – Body
        2 – Head
        3 – Legs
        4 – Eyes
        5 – Antenne
        6 – Tail

The rules for drawing the full beetle are as follows (

A body must be drawn before any other parts. A beetle without a body cannot have legs or a tail. Furthermore, the head must be drawn before the eyes and antenne can be added. If you roll a number associated with a body part that cannot be drawn, your turn is skipped and the next player rolls. The first player with a fully sketched beetle is the winner.
